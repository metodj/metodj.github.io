I am a 1st year PhD student in Machine Learning at [Uva-Bosch Delta Lab](https://ivi.fnwi.uva.nl/uvaboschdeltalab/)/[AMLab](http://amlab.science.uva.nl/) where I am fortunate to be supervised by [Prof. Eric Nalisnick](https://enalisnick.github.io/). Previously, I completed my Masters in Data Science at [ETH Zurich](https://ethz.ch/en.html) and gained industry experience working as a data scientist and quantitative engineer.

My research interests include, but are not limited to: bayesian deep learning, deep generative modeling, representation learning, and financial machine learning.
